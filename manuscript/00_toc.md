# Documentation - the Doc is in

# User Interface

> Discuss the pros and cons of both native GUI and the HTML5/JavaScript approach.

> Explain how important it is to separate business logic from UI:

> * It is then much easier to exchange one UI by another
> * It is also easier (or possible at all) to implement test cases for the business logic.

> Discuss why testing the UI as such is often not exactly a brilliant idea, and what exceptions there are and why.

# Providing help

> We introduce just Markdown2Help because
> 1. it needs nothing but Dyalog.
> 2. it provides a functionality that it very close to a CHM file.

> Although it's a Windows solution we still get a working --- though very basic --- HTML version for Linux and Mac OS.

# Writing an installer

> We focus on the Inno installer (easy) or Wix (meets the needs of large companies) ?

> We need to discuss the best way of how to install under Linux and Mac-OS with Andy.
